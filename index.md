**Description**: Nowadays, programming is one of the most needed skills. In this course, we'll learn some topics of
      advanced programming. Object-Oriented programming, data structure and algorithm analysis are the most important
      ones.
      Although all of these topics are independent of a special programming language, we use one of the most
      liked
      programming
      languages, which is <a  href="https://www.python.org/" target="_blank">Python!</a> We chose Python
      because it's simple and open source. In this
      course,
      most of our focus
      is on your Teamwork and programming activities. You'll learn Object-Oriented programming, and you'll have to
      implement a project as a final Teamwork result. At the end you'll be expected to write classes, use data
      structures and
      design a graphical user
      interface for your project.
